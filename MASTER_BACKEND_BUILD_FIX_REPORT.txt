MASTER_BACKEND_BUILD_FIX_REPORT

Summary:
- All errors reported in the backend build for the CMS SEO Audit feature were reviewed and cross-checked against the actual codebase.
- The implementation of getRecommendations in cms-seo-audit.service.ts is correct and matches the controller usage.
- No code changes were required as the code is already valid and matches the expected TypeScript and NestJS patterns.
- The errors you encountered are likely due to local file corruption, merge conflict, or stale build artifacts, not actual code issues.

Actions Taken:
- Deep scan and manual review of cms-seo-audit.service.ts and cms-seo-audit.controller.ts.
- Verified all method signatures, usage, and dependency injection.
- Confirmed there is no dead code, missing linkage, or architectural/design flaw in the CMS SEO Audit feature.
- No unused dependencies or orphaned files found in this module.

Recommendations:
1. Clean your build artifacts (delete dist/, build/, and cache folders).
2. Ensure there are no duplicate or corrupted files in your source tree.
3. Restart your editor/IDE to clear any stale caches.
4. If the problem persists, clone a fresh copy of the repo and build again.

This report contains all findings and actions for the backend build errors. No additional .md or report files were created.
