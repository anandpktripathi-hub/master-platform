It looks like you have tried to invoke the docker CLI from the docker-desktop WSL2 distribution. This is not supported.

Please invoke the docker CLI from the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, or other compatible terminals.

If you wish to interact with Docker Desktop from a third-party WSL2 distribution, such as Ubuntu, please enable the Docker Desktop WSL2 integration for it. See: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/#enabling-docker-support-in-wsl-2-distros
